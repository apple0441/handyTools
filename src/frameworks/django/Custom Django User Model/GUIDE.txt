Hello Everyone

Initial Developer Information:

I am Manoj Tyagi, an Engineering undergraduate student from India. This section belongs to the quick setup for Custom User model for a Django Project. I have assumed that you know Django Basics. If you don't know, then I suggest you to not consider this repo because this project is mainly designed for the developers who atleast know some basics and quickly implement them for rapid development of Projects.
Here's the Quick Guide for the the Custom User Model.

## This section is designed for only quick reference to code for rapid development of projects and not for learning purpose. So I have not included comments in order to avoid any confusion in the code. If anyone wants to include comments, then the contributions are heartly welcomed.

## The Project files are named as project_<file_name> prefix and the app files are named as app_<file_name> prefix in order to avoid any confusion for the developers.

## The section is self explained through code so there is no need to define what every line does. If any confusion or Issue persist, then please open an issue or mail us at tyagimanojtyagi.22@gmail.com

Thank you
