        <p>Tessarect: a blue cube which holds the Space Stone. This stone gives the user power over space and can create a portal from one part of the universe to another. The Space Stone has been held by: Odin, the Norwegian priest, Red Skull, Howard Stark, Mar-vell, Captain Marvel, Michelle Rambeau, Goose, Nick Fury, Hawkeye, Dr Selvig, Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, Loki, Thor, Ebony Maw, Thanos*</p>
        <p>Hurling Gamora off the cliff (or anyone whom you love) nets you the Soul Stone. It’s unclear what the Soul Stone’s powers are in the film universe. In the comics, the gem allows the holder to capture and control others’ souls. Only two have held the Soul Stone: Thanos*, Hawkeye*.</p>

        <p>Aether: a manifestation of The Reality Stone which grants the user power to manipulate matter. The Reality Stone has been held by: Malekith, Bor, Jane Foster, Sif the Collector, Thanos* and Rocket Raccoon</p>

        <p>Necklace called the Eye of Agomoto is where the Time Stone is hidden. The Time Stone grants its owner the power to re-wind or fast-forward time. The Time Stone was only held by the Ancient One and Doctor Strange before Thanos got his hands on it.</p>
        <p>Orb that contains the Power Stone seems to be a popular item across the universe. The Power Stone bestows upon its holder a lot of energy — the sort that you could use to destroy an entire planet. The Celestial, Star-Lord*, Korath, the broker, Gamora, Drax, the Collector, the Collector's assistant*, Nebula, Ronan*, Nova Prime, Thanos*, and War Machine have all held the Power Stone.</p>
        <p>Scepter. Loki's Scepter which could counter the immense enery of the Tessarect. Turns out, it's the Mind Stone! This yellow stone allows the user to control the minds of others and have been held by: Thanos*, Loki, Bruce Banner, Black Widow, Agent Sitwell, Agent Crossbones, Baron Strucker, Tony Stark, Ultron*, Vision, Captain America, Ant-Man</p>

            <h5>Iron Man/Tony Stark</h5>
            <p>
               In <em>Endgame</em>, we had to say goodbye to the most important Avenger. Even though he wasn't the leader of the Avengers, Iron Man has always been the team's driving force. His charisma and savvy helped the team bond, and he was instrumental in giving the Avengers a good public face. Tony was also the one bankrolling the Avengers — he built the tower they used as a home base, and he built their new upstate headquarters. Tony is literally giving them a place to assemble.</p>
            <p>There's perhaps no greater endorsement of Iron Man's status as the most important Avenger than Captain America's word. Cap called Tony "Earth's best defender." It's not hyperbolic, as over a ten-year career as a superhero, Tony truly has cemented himself as the greatest hero around. </p>

               What will we miss the most? Honestly? His quips and memorable quotes. From the iconic "Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist" line to coming up with fitting names — Lebowski for Bro Thor and Build-A-Bear for Rocket immediately come to mind — we are not convinced that there will be another character who can pull off throwing insults so flawlessly.</p>
            <p>
               Our only consolation is that there is hope that Morgan Stark will grow up and follow in the footsteps of her father. Until then, we'll just have to watch YouTube compilations of Tony Stark's best moments. Here's to Iron Man and Robert Downey Jr, the anchor of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. </p>

        <div class="character-other__text"> 
          <h5>Black Widow </h5>
          <p>We didn't care much for Black Widow and had very little emotional attachment to her character. Turns out, all it needed to make her death the hardest for us was her complete dedication to the Avengers for 5 years post Thanos-snap and a tear-jerking sacrificial jump, with her best friend unwillingly sending her off.</p>

          <p>
             Wait, hear us out. Proxima Midnight & Corvus Glaive were actually married. Joe Russo <a href="https://comicbook.com/marvel/2018/08/03/avengers-infinity-black-order-proxima-midnight-corvus-glaive-married/">mentioned that they did have plans to explore their relations but the plot threads were ultimately cut for time.</a>. We're just lowkey disappointed that we didn't get that story.</p>

          <h5>Young Cassie </h5>
          <p>
             We are glad she wasn't snapped and we know teenage Cassie is important to pave the way to the <a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Cassandra_Lang_(Earth-616)">Young Avengers</a>. But man, Abby Ryder Johnson is the best child actor we've seen and we sure will miss this little peanut.</p>

      <div class="text">
         Oh boy, we have so many questions. Perhaps the most hotly debated <em>Endgame</em> plot point is the fate of Captain America, who travels back in time to live out his life with Peggy Carter. It is established that Peggy had a husband and two kids, and some fans have theorized that Steve Rogers secretly was this husband all along. Others have stated that Steve created an alternate timeline when he went back to live with Peggy, and somehow got back to the mainline MCU as an old man. In conclusion, we are unsure. All we know is that the shield has been passed onto the Falcon (but he will not take on the name like in the comics, as the name of a new Disney+ show is <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em>) and Chris Evans is done with the MCU. So maybe we won't have to say goodbye to Captain America, but we'll unfortunately have to bid farewell to our favorite Chris.</div>
